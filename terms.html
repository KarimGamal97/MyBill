            <p>
              By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically
              apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them
              carefully before using the app.
            </p>
            <p>
              You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app,
              or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
              extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to
              translate the app into other languages or make derivative
              versions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database
              rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it,
              still belong to Mybill .
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">1. Application principle</h2>
            <p>
              Mybill is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
              efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to
              make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
              and for any reason.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will never charge you for the app or its services without
              making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for
            </p>
            <p>
              The Mybill app stores and processes personal data that you have
              provided to us, to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to
              keep your phone and access to the app secure.
            </p>
            <p>
              We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your
              phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and
              limitations imposed by the official operating system of your
              device.
            </p>
            <p>
              It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
              programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could
              mean that the Mybill app won’t work properly or at all.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">2. Awarness about mybill</h2>
            <p>
              You should be aware that there are certain things that Mybill will
              not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will
              require the app to have an active internet connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network
              provider, but Mybill cannot take responsibility for the app not
              working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi,
              and you don’t have any of your data allowance left .
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">3. Connect to wifi or mobile data</h2>
            <p>
              If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
              remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network
              provider will still apply.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the
              cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing
              the app, or other third-party charges.
            </p>
            <p>
              . In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
              charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside
              of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning
              off data roaming.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">4. pay the bill of using app</h2>
            <p>
              If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using
              the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received
              permission from the bill payer for using the app
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">5. Charge your mobile well</h2>
            <p>
              Along the same lines, Mybill cannot always take responsibility for
              the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your
              device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t
              turn it on to avail the Service, Mybill cannot accept
              responsibility .
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">6. Respect our policies</h2>
            <p>
              With respect to Mybill ’s responsibility for your use of the app,
              when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that
              although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at
              all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to
              us so that we can make it available to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mybill accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
              experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of
              the app. At some point, we may wish to update the app.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">7. Available on IOS</h2>
            <p>
              The app is currently available on iOS – the requirements for the
              system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
              availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to
              download the updates if you want to keep using the app.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">8. Update for more features !</h2>
            <p>
              Mybill does not promise that it will always update the app so that
              it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you
              have installed on your device.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">9. update and Features</h2>
            <p>
              However, you promise to always accept updates to the application
              when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app,
              and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
              termination to you.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights
              and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must
              stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device .
            </p>
            <p>
              Changes to This Terms and Conditions I may update our Terms and
              Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this
              page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any
              changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.
